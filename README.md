# Stock Overflow (frontend)

> I'm still surprised this domain wasn't taken ðŸ¤·

A typescript React web application with Sass-styling built from scratch without `npx create-react-app`; using webpack and babel instead.

## What does it do?
The React application serves as the frontend for the stockoverflow application. It displays current market trends and stock news in one simplistic and configurable interface.

Users can define their portfolio and watch their stock develop over time. In addition, they can create a watchlist with interesting stocks and follow their development.

## How do I set it up?
Run these commands in your projects directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:samihamed/stockoverflow.git
cd stockoverflow
npm i
npm run dev
```
